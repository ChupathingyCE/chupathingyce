# Dedicated server changelog

What changed in the ChupathingyCE Dedicated Server. The server is released
with the game and has its version; the game's own changes are in its
release notes.

## Unreleased

- The server is a program of its own, `chupathingyce-server`, for Linux
  only, in three downloads: `chupathingyce-server-linux-x64`,
  `chupathingyce-server-linux-arm64` (new: Oracle Cloud's free tier,
  Raspberry Pi 4 and 5, Ampere) and `chupathingyce-server-linux-x86`.
- One static file: no SDL, OpenGL or sound libraries, and no C library
  version to match. It runs on any Linux of its architecture.
- `--version` and `--help`. Without a playlist it says how to start one;
  without maps, or with a playlist it cannot read, it stops at once with a
  clear error.
- One container image for every architecture, on Alpine Linux, not root by
  default.
- Custom Edition and HaloMD maps on the x64 and arm64 servers.

HALO_CONSOLE_FEATURES.H

What a console build of the shared platform layer and game code asks of
them, as capabilities any console can turn on (included by
halo_linux_prefix.h). The shared code tests these, never a console's name;
a console turns a capability on by defining it here from its own build's
define. The Switch (HALO_SWITCH_CONSOLE) is the first to use them.

HALO_CONSOLE_GPU_RESOURCE_HOOKS
	a renderer whose GPU reads the game's memory after the draw: resources
	report busy and locks wait for the GPU (halo_resource_busy and
	halo_resource_wait, weak in port/linux/src/d3d8_resources.c, defined
	for real by the console's renderer), and a busy dynamic vertex buffer
	gets other storage instead of waiting
HALO_CONSOLE_NO_WRITE_WATCH
	a console that will not write-protect guest memory, so the renderer's
	write watch cannot see the game write a resource: locks and file reads
	into the window say so themselves (memory_watch_prepare_write)
HALO_CONSOLE_HOST_ART
	a host renderer of its own: read-only accessors for the menus' art
	(menu_files.h), the high-res HUD's PNGs and the text atlas (hud_hires.h,
	text_hires.h), and a map's HUD sheets handed to the host to decode
	(dk_hud_prepare, dk_hud_forget)
HALO_CONSOLE_MAP_LOAD_HOOKS
	a renderer told when a map loads (d3d8_gl_map_loaded, from
	scenario_load) and that compiles its shaders under the loading screen,
	which waits for them (d3d8_gl_map_loading, d3d8_gl_map_progress,
	d3d8_gl_map_waiting, from game_precache_new_map)
HALO_CONSOLE_STATUS_LINE
	terminal_status_printf: one console line kept on screen and rewritten
	(source/interface/terminal.c)
HALO_CONSOLE_LOG_THROTTLE
	a console whose log writes are slow (debug.txt on a card): the host's
	notices are logged without their blank lines, at most three a second
	(port/linux/game/network_distributed.c)
